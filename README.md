<h1 align="left" style="font-size: 2.5em;">Absenteeism in the Workplace</h1>

This project explores predicting workplace absenteeism based on various employee attributes and lifestyle factors. The analysis uses three regression models—Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression—to determine the best predictive approach. Each model provides unique insights:

Multiple Linear Regression establishes a baseline prediction.
Lasso Regression focuses on refining variable selection to prevent overfitting.
Decision Tree Regression captures complex relationships within the data.
The project compares model performances, offering insights into how both personal and work-related factors influence absenteeism.
