This is a project i completed during my studies at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
The goal was to predict absenteeism in the workplace, given characteristic and life style details of employees.
3 types of models were employed to observe performance across all and determine which one is optimal:
    - multiple linear regression
    - Lasso regression
    - Decision tree
